# To-Do-List
creates and edits a to do list of tasks
this project uses nested ifs. If you say no to one process, it will move to the next one until you either say yes to the quit function or cycle to the bottom of the available actions. To interact with a process, either type "yes" or "no" in lowercase when prompted through the input window.
Thanks to Fabian Rodriguez for collaborating on this project.
